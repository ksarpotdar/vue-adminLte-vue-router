adminLte : A nice set of management system framework, suitable for SPA application

**2017-05-28**

This project is no longer followed up. The reason is that many problems that need to be optimized have been found during the integration process, and there are also problems due to changes in the vue version.

It is estimated that many coders used have been optimized a lot. I am sorry to everyone here, and I am planning to restart a new project

**2016-11-18更新加入 Vuex2.0，使大型应用的状态共享更方便**

Ps: Don't forget to install vuex dependencies when updating the project

this.$store.state
//具体的store文件在src/store下面
//最新版的demo中、attendance页面可以看到alert的数据
The first loading will judge that the jump on the mobile terminal will automatically close the menu

After integration, other libraries (jq, bs, etc.) used in it are configured with webpack in the official scaffolding, so that the project can run, and related plug-ins can also be used

Use vue-cli to build integration and help users skip some pitfalls
